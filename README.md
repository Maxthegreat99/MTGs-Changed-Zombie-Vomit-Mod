# Credits
- Programming by yours truly 
- [Onilink](http://ic.onidev.fr/en/index.html) who helped me make 90% of this mod by answer
- spaghettiinabucket who made the sprites, fr thx to him (ill never have his art skills)
- Redigit or whatever sound designer there is at Relogic tbh (we used the WoF summon leech sound effect for the vomit sound)

# The Game
if you dont know Planet Centauri go check it out they just released 1.0, a lot of reviews arent favoring them on steam but mostly because the game has a lot of rough edges and is only made by 2 guys who dedicate their time and money to give us this game. In a few years this game might be absolutely great
